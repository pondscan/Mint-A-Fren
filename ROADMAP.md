# Magma Frens Project Roadmap

## Introduction

**Magma Frens** are a captivating collection of digital companions, known as *Frens*, that offer both the charm of collectible NFTs and a meaningful role within an expansive, engaging ecosystem. Initially introduced on the Magma Onyx testnet, these Frens are set to evolve and flourish on the forthcoming Magma Mainnet, embodying our vision of a community-centric, interactive, and technologically advanced platform.
